# From Size Perception to Counting

## This code is part of a p.h.D thesis written by Gali Katz, 2023.
The code uses core components from DeepEvolve which is based on Matt Harvey's Keras code (2017).

DeepEvolve is a public github repository that was designed to help solving problems
such as which network architectures (i.e., the number of layers,
number of inner nodes, etc.) to choose and which hyperparameters
(i.e., batch size, number of epochs, etc.) to use by returning optimal hyperparameters for classification problems.

In order to fit our simulation needs, the DeepEvolve code was re-written 
almost entirely but the main core code for mutations and recombination was kept.
